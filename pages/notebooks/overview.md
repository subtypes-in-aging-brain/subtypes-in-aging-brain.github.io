Aging progression patterns for the two brain ageing subtypes identified by SuStaIn. Each progression pattern consists of a sequence of stages in which regional brain volumes reach selected Z-scores (sigma) relative to the controls. Subtype 1 shows early (midtemporal and parietal) cortical atrophy, whereas Subtype 2 shows early ventricular enlargement and total brain atrophy. `f` is the proportion of participants estimated to belong to each subtype.
