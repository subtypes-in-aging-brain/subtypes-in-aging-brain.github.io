```{epigraph}
The idea of measuring brain health by estimating a brain age has been around for a few years. Several studies have measured participants' brain age using structural MRI. But do we all age in the same way ? In this study, we explore if there are distinct pathways of progression within normal aging and if we can identify these subtypes in a data-driven way. 

--  This website aims to serve as a web application for using our model on identifying the data-driven subtypes of brain aging, for identifying subtypes in your own data!

## **EuroPOND project in a nutshell**

The EuroPOND initiative is a unique team of scientists spanning computational neuroscience and clinical neurology. Together we are developing computational models and using state-of-the-art data-science techniques to understand a range of neurological disorders. We are learning characteristic patterns of progression directly from large medical data sets including Alzheimer’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, normal aging, and abnormal brain development in preterm infants. These disease signatures will enable improved diagnosis and management of neurological disorders.

The EuroPOND consortium has a multidisciplinary balance of essential expertise in mathematical/statistical/computational modelling; clinical, biomedical and epidemiological expertise
